# Data-Structures-Simplified

This repository aims to make data structures more simplified and easy to understand, especially for beginners or anyone new to the topic. It's also a personal project for me to learn and master the core principles of data structures.

## Types of Data Structures
- Linear Data Structures
- Non-Linear Data Structures

## Linear Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queue

## Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

## Arrays Simplified:

An array is like a row of boxes where you can store items. Each box has a number called an index. Think of it as a line of mailboxes in an apartment building.

## Key Points:

- Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, meaning you decide how many boxes (or elements) there will
  be when you create it.
- Indexed: Each box in the array has an index starting from 0. This helps you find and access items
  quickly.
- Homogeneous: All the items in an array must be of the same data types, like all letters,     
  numbers, or objects.
- Contiguous Memory: The items are stored one after another in memory, which allows for fast 
  access to any element using its index.

## Example:

Let's say you have an array of numbers: `[3, 8, 12, 5, 9]`.
- Index 0: 3
- Index 1: 8
- Index 2: 12
- Index 3: 5
- Index 4: 9

You can access the numbers by specifying their index, like `array[2]` to get `12`.

## Common Operations:
- Access: Get the value at a specific index.
- Insertion: Add a new item at a particular position.
- Deletion: Remove an item from a specific position.
- Update: Change the value at a certain index.

## Usage:

Array are used in various algorithms, data storage, and representing mathematical concepts.



## Linked List Simplified:

Imagine a chain of connected blocks. Each block holds a piece of information and points to the next block in the chain, forming a sequence. That's what a linked list is like.

## Key Points:

- Nodes: Each block in the linked list is called a "node". It contains both data and a reference
  (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
- Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically because each node points
  to the next one,
- No Contiguous Memory: Nodes can be scattered in memory, not necessarily next to each other.
- Types:
     - Singly Linked Lists: Each node points to the next one in the sequence. It's like a chain
       where you can only move forward.
     - Doubly Linked Lists:
